# pond_spawn
A neural network-based evolution simulator where agents compete for food and reproduce in a 10x10 grid environment.

## Overview
This project simulates artificial life using neural networks and genetic algorithms. Agents with unique genomes make decisions using their "brains" (neural networks) to survive, eat, and reproduce. Over time, natural selection should favor beneficial traits and behaviors.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Brain (`controllers/brain.py`)** âœ… COMPLETE
- PyTorch neural network built from JSON configuration
- Loads weights from genome at initialization
- Winner-takes-all output: 4 neurons determine agent actions
- Network architecture: 5 inputs â†’ 8 hidden (tanh) â†’ 8 hidden (tanh) â†’ 4 outputs
- 156 total trainable parameters

**Inputs (5):**
- Normalized energy level (0-1)
- Food at current position (0-1)
- Nearby agent count (0-1)
- Biome visibility (0-1)
- Biome movement speed (0-1)

**Outputs (4):**
- ACTION_MOVE: Move forward in current heading
- ACTION_TURN: Turn 90Â° clockwise
- ACTION_EAT: Consume food at current tile
- ACTION_REPRODUCE: Create mutated offspring (25% energy cost)

#### 2. **Genome (`controllers/genome.py`)** âœ… COMPLETE
- Genetic blueprint defining agent traits and brain weights
- Class-based implementation with generation and mutation
- 7 mutable traits: vision, speed, metabolism, nutrition, energy capacity, mutation rate, reproduction threshold
- 156 brain weights stored as flat list
- Mutation: 10% chance per trait/weight, factor 0.85-1.02

#### 3. **Biome (`controllers/landscape.py`)** âœ… COMPLETE
- Environmental tile properties
- Features: movement_speed (0.8-1.05), visibility (0.25-1.0), food_units (0-3)
- Randomly generated from base template
- Affects agent perception and movement costs

#### 4. **Agent (`controllers/agent.py`)** âœ… COMPLETE
- Individual organism with genome, brain, position, energy, age, heading
- Perception: Gathers normalized sensory data from environment
- Decision: Brain outputs winner-takes-all action selection
- Actions: Move, turn, eat, reproduce
- Metabolism: Base cost + movement cost + action costs
- Reproduction: Costs 25% energy, creates mutated offspring in adjacent tile

#### 5. **Environment (`simulation.py`)** âœ… COMPLETE
- 10x10 grid of biomes
- 100 starting agents, 150 food units (avg 1.5 per tile, max 3 per tile)
- Manages agent updates, reproduction, death
- Tracks statistics: population, food, average energy
- Helper methods: `get_biome()`, `get_agents_at()`, `count_agents_in_range()`

### Test Suite (`tests/`)  âœ… COMPLETE
- **test_brain.py**: 26 tests covering initialization, forward pass, weight counting, genome loading
- **test_genome.py**: 39 tests covering generation, mutation, serialization, integration
- **65 tests total, all passing** âœ…

### ðŸš§ In Progress / TODO

#### High Priority
- [ ] **Multi-agent eating priority**: Implement speed-based eating order when multiple agents on same tile
- [ ] **Food respawn system**: Add periodic food generation to sustain population
- [ ] **Energy capacity limits**: Enforce max energy from genome trait
- [ ] **Visualization**: Create visual representation of grid state (Pygame/Matplotlib)
- [ ] **Data logging**: Track evolution metrics (avg traits, population, survival time)

#### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Biome effects**: Apply movement_speed and visibility modifiers to agent actions
- [ ] **Vision range**: Implement proper vision-based perception using genome vision trait
- [ ] **Reproduction threshold**: Use genome `clone_energy_threshold` instead of fixed 25%
- [ ] **Daily nutrition**: Implement `daily_nutrition_minimum` survival requirement
- [ ] **Mutation rate**: Use genome `mutation_rate` trait in mutation logic
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Spatial indexing for large populations

#### Low Priority / Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Save/load simulation state**: Serialize entire environment to JSON
- [ ] **Multiple species**: Color-coded lineages or species divergence
- [ ] **Advanced biomes**: Add water/land, predator zones, etc.
- [ ] **Sexual reproduction**: Crossover between two parents
- [ ] **Learning**: Online weight updates based on success
- [ ] **Visualization dashboard**: Real-time charts and heatmaps
- [ ] **Configuration UI**: Adjust simulation parameters without code changes
