Tossing out the old AI README and writing my own. This will serve double-duty as a devlog of sorts as I stumble my way through this.

I tossed out the old readme (it was an ai stand-in made by Copilot) and decided to make my own. The agents brain is not choosing to 'Eat' enough, resulting in starvation, depopulation, and a HUGE accumulation of food. Thoughts on why this is below:
<ul>
    <li>Too much food, obviously<li>
    <li>The brain is too simple. There should be threshold triggers that are checked before the brain is called</li>
</ul>
